# A simple dungeon crawler card battler (kinda)

No body has ever thought about merging combat and cards before, I know that!
I hope the idea turns out good enough though :)

You drag cards from your hand on the table (I don't know where that is either, we can play on the balck void for now xd), and make a spell with three cards. Currently, there are only 3 kind og cards (Red, Green and Blue). Because the order of the cards on the table matters, you can make 27 different spells in theory. Right now the spells are limited but I'll add to them probably :)

Combat is turn based, you and your enemy put cards turn by turn, and each card that was used in a spell won't come back to your hand untill you rest for a turn.

There is a difficulty settings which for now, only increases the health amount of enemies. And the coin system was recently added but you can only gather them, no use for them for now XD
